# Blink-detection
A Matlab program with interface to detect blinks from videos and save the frames automatically. It uses automatic eye detection but can also be disabled to manually indicate the eye region by clicking in the four corners of a rectangle area. The blink detector algorithm is based on a white sclera thresholding method that can be also customised in the interface.
